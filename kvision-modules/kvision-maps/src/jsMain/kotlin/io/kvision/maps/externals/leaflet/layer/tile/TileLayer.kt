/**
 * Used to load and display tile layers on the map. Note that most tile servers require
 * attribution, which you can set under [TileLayerOptions.attribution].
 *
 *
 * @param[urlTemplate] A string of the following form:
 * ```
 * http://{s}.somedomain.com/blabla/{z}/{x}/{y}{r}.png
 * ```
 * * `{s}` means one of the available subdomains (used sequentially to help with browser parallel
 *   requests per domain limitation; subdomain values are specified in options; `a`, `b` or `c` by
 *   default, can be omitted),
 * * `{z}` — zoom level,
 * * `{x}` and `{y}` — tile coordinates.
 * * `{r}` can be used to add `"@2x"` to the URL to load retina tiles.
 *
 *  You can use custom keys in the template, which will be evaluated from [TileLayer] options,
 *  like this:
 *
 *  ```kotlin
 *  LeafletObjectFactory.tileLayer("http://{s}.somedomain.com/{foo}/{z}/{x}/{y}.png") {
 *    asDynamic().foo = "bar"
 *  }
 *  ```
